perform computation computation might something mathematical solving system equations finding roots polynomial also symbolic computation searching replacing text document strangely enough compiling program details look different different languages basic instructions appear every language input Get data keyboard file device output Display data screen send data file device math Perform basic mathematical operations like addition multiplication conditional execution Check certain conditions execute appropriate code repetition Perform action repeatedly usually variation Believe that’s pretty much Every program you’ve ever used matter complicated made instructions look pretty much like think programming process breaking large complex task smaller smaller subtasks subtasks simple enough performed one basic instructions may little vague come back topic talk algorithms13What debuggingProgramming errorprone whimsical reasons programming errors called bugs process tracking called debugging Three kinds errors occur program syntax errors runtime errors semantic errors useful distinguish order track quickly131Syntax errorsPython execute program syntax correct otherwise interpreter displays error message Syntax refers structure program rules structure example parentheses come matching pairs 1 2 legal 8 syntax error English readers tolerate syntax errors read poetry e e cummings without spewing error messages Python forgiving single syntax error anywhere program Python display error message quit able run program first weeks programming career probably spend lot time tracking syntax errors gain experience make fewer errors find faster 4132Chapter 1 way programRuntime errorsThe second type error runtime error called error appear program started running errors also called exceptions usually indicate something exceptional bad happened Runtime errors rare simple programs see first chapters might encounter one133Semantic errorsThe third type error semantic error semantic error program run successfully sense computer generate error messages right thing something else Specifically told problem program wrote program wanted write meaning program semantics wrong Identifying semantic errors tricky requires work backward looking output program trying figure doing134Experimental debuggingOne important skills acquire debugging Although frustrating debugging one intellectually rich challenging interesting parts programming ways debugging like detective work confronted clues infer processes events led results see Debugging also like experimental science idea going wrong modify program try hypothesis correct predict result modification take step closer working program hypothesis wrong come new one Sherlock Holmes pointed “When eliminated impossible whatever remains however improbable must truth” Conan Doyle Sign Four people programming debugging thing programming process gradually debugging program want idea start program something make small modifications debugging go always working program example Linux operating system contains thousands lines code started simple program Linus Torvalds used explore Intel 80386 chip According Larry Greenfield “One Linus’s earlier projects program would switch printing AAAA BBBB later evolved Linux” Linux Users’ Guide Beta Version 1 Later chapters make suggestions debugging programming practices 14 Formal natural languages145Formal natural languagesNatural languages languages people speak English Spanish French designed people although people try impose order evolved naturally Formal languages languages designed people specific applications example notation mathematicians use formal language particularly good denoting relationships among numbers symbols Chemists use formal language represent chemical structure molecules importantly Programming languages formal languages designed express computations Formal languages tend strict rules syntax example 3 3 6 syntactically correct mathematical statement 3 36 H2 syntactically correct chemical formula 2 Zz Syntax rules come two flavors pertaining tokens structure Tokens basic elements language words numbers chemical elements One problems 3 36 legal token mathematics least far know Similarly 2 Zz legal element abbreviation Zz second type syntax rule pertains structure statement way tokens arranged statement 3 3 illegal even though legal tokens can’t one right Similarly chemical formula subscript comes element name Exercise 11 Write wellstructured English sentence invalid tokens write another sentence valid tokens invalid structure read sentence English statement formal language figure structure sentence although natural language subconsciously process called parsing example hear sentence “The penny dropped” understand “the penny” subject “dropped” predicate parsed sentence figure means semantics sentence Assuming know penny means drop understand general implication sentence Although formal natural languages many features common—tokens structure syntax semantics—there differences ambiguity Natural languages full ambiguity people deal using contextual clues information Formal languages designed nearly completely unambiguous means statement exactly one meaning regardless context redundancy order make ambiguity reduce misunderstandings natural languages employ lots redundancy result often verbose Formal languages less redundant concise 6Chapter 1 way programliteralness Natural languages full idiom metaphor say “The penny dropped” probably penny nothing dropping idiom means someone realized something period confusion Formal languages mean exactly say People grow speaking natural language—everyone—often hard time adjusting formal languages ways difference formal natural language like difference poetry prose Poetry Words used sounds well meaning whole poem together creates effect emotional response Ambiguity common often deliberate Prose literal meaning words important structure contributes meaning Prose amenable analysis poetry still often ambiguous Programs meaning computer program unambiguous literal understood entirely analysis tokens structure suggestions reading programs formal languages First remember formal languages much dense natural languages takes longer read Also structure important usually good idea read top bottom left right Instead learn parse program head identifying tokens interpreting structure Finally details matter Small errors spelling punctuation get away natural languages make big difference formal language15The first programTraditionally first program write new language called “Hello World” display words “Hello World” Python looks like thisprint Hello World example print statement doesn’t actually print

remainder first operand divided second Python modulus operator percent sign syntax operators quotient 7 3 print quotient 2 remainder 7 3 print remainder 1 7 divided 3 2 1 left modulus operator turns surprisingly useful example check whether one number divisible another—if x zero x divisible Also extract rightmost digit digits number example x 10 yields rightmost digit x base 10 Similarly x 100 yields last two digits52Boolean expressionsA boolean expression expression either true false following examples use operator compares two operands produces True equal False otherwise 5 5 True 5 6 False True False special values belong type bool strings typeTrue type bool typeFalse type bool 42Chapter 5 Conditionals recursionThe operator one relational operators others x x equal x x greater x x less x x greater equal x x less equal Although operations probably familiar Python symbols different mathematical symbols common error use single equal sign instead double equal sign Remember assignment operator relational operator thing 53Logical operatorsThere three logical operators semantics meaning operators similar meaning English example x 0 x 10 true x greater 0 less 10n2 0 n3 0 true either conditions true number divisible 2 3 Finally operator negates boolean expression x true x false x less equal Strictly speaking operands logical operators boolean expressions Python strict nonzero number interpreted “true” 17 True True flexibility useful subtleties might confusing might want avoid unless know doing54Conditional executionIn order write useful programs almost always need ability check conditions change behavior program accordingly Conditional statements give us ability simplest form statement x 0 print x positive boolean expression called condition true indented statement gets executed nothing happensif statements structure function definitions header followed indented body Statements like called compound statements limit number statements appear body least one Occasionally useful body statements usually place keeper code haven’t written yet case use pass statement nothing x 0 pass need handle negative values 55 Alternative execution5543Alternative executionA second form statement alternative execution two possibilities condition determines one gets executed syntax looks like thisif x2 0 print x even else print x odd remainder x divided 2 0 know x even program displays message effect condition false second set statements executed Since condition must true false exactly one alternatives executed alternatives called branches branches flow execution56Chained conditionalsSometimes two possibilities need two branches One way express computation like chained conditionalif x print x less elif x print x greater else print x equal elif abbreviation “else if” exactly one branch executed limit number elif statements else clause end doesn’t one choice drawa elif choice b drawb elif choice c drawc condition checked order first false next checked one true corresponding branch executes statement ends Even one condition true first true branch executes57Nested conditionalsOne conditional also nested within another could written trichotomy example like thisif x print x equal else x 44Chapter 5 Conditionals recursionprint x less else print x greater outer conditional contains two branches first branch contains simple statement second branch contains another statement two branches two branches simple statements although could conditional statements well Although indentation statements makes structure apparent nested conditionals become difficult read quickly general good idea avoid Logical operators often provide way simplify nested conditional statements example rewrite following code using single conditionalif

errors produced Python translating source code byte code usually indicate something wrong syntax program Example Omitting colon end def statement yields somewhat redundant message SyntaxError invalid syntax • Runtime errors produced interpreter something goes wrong program running runtime error messages include information error occurred functions executing Example infinite recursion eventually causes runtime error “maximum recursion depth exceeded” • Semantic errors problems program runs without producing error messages doesn’t right thing Example expression may evaluated order expect yielding incorrect result first step debugging figure kind error dealing Although following sections organized error type techniques applicable one situationA1Syntax errorsSyntax errors usually easy fix figure Unfortunately error messages often helpful common messages SyntaxError invalid syntax SyntaxError invalid token neither informative hand message tell program problem occurred Actually tells Python noticed problem necessarily error Sometimes error prior location error message often preceding line 194Appendix DebuggingIf building program incrementally good idea error last line added copying code book start comparing code book’s code carefully Check every character time remember book might wrong see something looks like syntax error might ways avoid common syntax errors 1 Make sure using Python keyword variable name 2 Check colon end header every compound statement including def statements 3 Make sure strings code matching quotation marks 4 multiline strings triple quotes single double make sure terminated string properly unterminated string may cause invalid token error end program may treat following part program string comes next string second case might produce error message 5 unclosed opening operator— —makes Python continue next line part current statement Generally error occurs almost immediately next line 6 Check classic instead inside conditional 7 Check indentation make sure lines way supposed Python handle space tabs mix cause problems best way avoid problem use text editor knows Python generates consistent indentation nothing works move next sectionA11I keep making changes makes differenceIf interpreter says error don’t see might interpreter looking code Check programming environment make sure program editing one Python trying run sure try putting obvious deliberate syntax error beginning program run interpreter doesn’t find new error running new code likely culprits • edited file forgot save changes running programming environments don’t • changed name file still running old name • Something development environment configured incorrectly A2 Runtime errors195• writing module using import make sure don’t give module name one standard Python modules • using import read module remember restart interpreter use reload read modified file import module doesn’t anything get stuck can’t figure going one approach start new program like “Hello World” make sure get known program run gradually add pieces original program new oneA2Runtime errorsOnce program syntactically correct Python compile least start running could possibly go wrongA21My program absolutely nothingThis problem common file consists functions classes actually invoke anything start execution may intentional plan import module supply classes functions intentional make sure invoking function start execution execute one interactive prompt Also see “Flow Execution” section belowA22My program hangsIf program stops seems nothing “hanging” Often means caught infinite loop infinite recursion • particular loop suspect problem add print statement immediately loop says “entering loop” another immediately says “exiting loop” Run program get first message second you’ve got infinite loop Go “Infinite Loop” section • time infinite recursion cause program run produce “RuntimeError Maximum recursion depth exceeded” error happens go “Infinite Recursion” section getting error suspect problem recursive method function still use techniques “Infinite Recursion” section • neither steps works start testing loops recursive functions methods • doesn’t work possible don’t understand flow execution program Go “Flow Execution” section 196Appendix DebuggingInfinite Loop think infinite loop think know loop causing problem add print statement end loop prints values variables condition value condition examplewhile x 0 0 something x something print x x print print condition x 0 0 run program see three lines output time loop last time loop condition false loop keeps going able see values x might figure updated correctlyInfinite Recursion time infinite recursion cause program run produce Maximum recursion depth exceeded error suspect function method causing infinite recursion start checking make sure base case words condition cause function method return without making recursive invocation need rethink algorithm identify base case base case program doesn’t seem reaching add print statement beginning function method prints parameters run program see lines output every time function method invoked see parameters parameters moving toward base case get ideas notFlow Execution sure flow execution moving program add print statements beginning function message like “entering function foo” foo name function run program print trace

error occurred see figure happened common runtime errors NameError trying use variable doesn’t exist current environment Remember local variables local cannot refer outside function defined TypeError several possible causes • trying use value improperly Example indexing string list tuple something integer • mismatch items format string items passed conversion happen either number items match invalid conversion called • passing wrong number arguments function method methods look method definition check first parameter self look method invocation make sure invoking method object right type providing arguments correctly KeyError trying access element dictionary using key dictionary contain AttributeError trying access attribute method exist Check spelling use dir list attributes exist AttributeError indicates object NoneType means None One common cause forgetting return value function get end function without hitting return statement returns None Another common cause using result

input causes problem Second clean program Remove dead code reorganize program make easy read possible example suspect problem deeply nested part program try rewriting part simpler structure suspect large function try splitting smaller functions testing separately Often process finding minimal test case leads bug find program works one situation another gives clue going Similarly rewriting piece

supposed doesn’t seem happening Find section code performs function make sure executing think • something happening shouldn’t Find code program performs function see executing shouldn’t • section code producing effect expected Make sure understand code question especially involves invocations functions methods Python modules Read documentation functions invoke Try writing simple test cases checking

programA program sequence instructions specifies perform computation computation might something mathematical solving system equations finding roots polynomial also symbolic computation searching replacing text document strangely enough compiling program details look different different languages basic instructions appear every language input Get data keyboard file device output Display data screen send data file device math Perform basic mathematical operations like addition multiplication conditional execution Check certain conditions execute appropriate code repetition Perform action repeatedly usually variation Believe thats pretty much Every program youve ever used matter complicated made instructions look pretty much like think programming process breaking large complex task smaller smaller subtasks subtasks simple enough performed one basic instructions may little vague come back topic talk algorithms13What debuggingProgramming errorprone whimsical reasons programming errors called bugs process tracking called debugging Three kinds errors occur program syntax errors runtime errors semantic errors useful distinguish order track quickly131Syntax errorsPython execute program syntax correct otherwise interpreter displays error message Syntax refers structure program rules structure example parentheses come matching pairs 1 2 legal 8 syntax error English readers tolerate syntax errors read poetry e e cummings without spewing error messages Python forgiving single syntax error anywhere program Python display error message quit able run program first weeks programming career probably spend lot time tracking syntax errors gain experience make fewer errors find faster 4132Chapter 1 way programRuntime errorsThe second type error runtime error called error

impose order evolved naturally Formal languages languages designed people specific applications example notation mathematicians use formal language particularly good denoting relationships among numbers symbols Chemists use formal language represent chemical structure molecules importantly Programming languages formal languages designed express computations Formal languages tend strict rules syntax example 3 3 6 syntactically correct mathematical statement 3 36 H2 syntactically correct chemical formula 2 Zz Syntax rules come two flavors pertaining tokens structure Tokens basic elements

tokens arranged statement 3 3 illegal even though legal tokens cant one right Similarly chemical formula subscript comes element name Exercise 11 Write wellstructured English sentence invalid tokens write another sentence valid tokens invalid structure read sentence English statement formal language figure structure sentence although natural language subconsciously process called parsing example hear sentence The penny dropped understand the penny subject dropped predicate parsed sentence figure means semantics sentence Assuming know penny means drop understand general implication sentence Although formal natural languages many features common—tokens structure syntax semantics—there differences ambiguity Natural languages full ambiguity people deal using contextual clues information Formal languages designed nearly completely unambiguous means statement exactly one meaning regardless context redundancy order make ambiguity reduce misunderstandings natural languages employ lots redundancy result often verbose Formal languages less redundant concise 6Chapter 1 way programliteralness Natural languages full idiom metaphor say The penny dropped probably penny nothing dropping idiom means someone realized something period confusion Formal languages mean exactly say People grow speaking natural language—everyone—often hard time adjusting formal languages ways difference formal natural language like difference poetry prose Poetry Words used sounds well meaning whole poem together creates effect emotional response Ambiguity common often deliberate Prose literal meaning words important structure contributes meaning Prose amenable analysis poetry still often ambiguous Programs meaning computer program unambiguous literal understood entirely analysis tokens structure suggestions reading programs formal languages First remember formal languages much dense natural languages takes longer read Also structure important usually good idea read top bottom left right Instead learn parse program head identifying tokens interpreting structure Finally details matter Small errors spelling punctuation get away natural languages make big difference formal language15The

remainder first operand divided second Python modulus operator percent sign syntax operators quotient 7 3 print quotient 2 remainder 7 3 print remainder 1 7 divided 3 2 1 left modulus operator turns surprisingly useful example check whether one number divisible another—if x zero x divisible Also extract rightmost digit digits number example x 10 yields rightmost digit x base 10 Similarly x 100 yields last two digits52Boolean expressionsA boolean expression expression either true false following examples use operator compares two operands produces True equal False otherwise 5 5 True 5 6 False True False special values belong type bool strings typeTrue type bool typeFalse type bool 42Chapter 5 Conditionals recursionThe operator one relational operators others x x equal x x greater x x less x x greater equal x x less equal Although operations probably familiar Python symbols different mathematical symbols common error use single equal sign instead double equal sign Remember assignment operator relational operator thing 53Logical operatorsThere three logical operators semantics meaning operators similar meaning English example x 0 x 10 true x greater 0 less 10n2 0 n3 0 true either conditions true number divisible 2 3 Finally operator negates boolean expression x true x false x less equal Strictly speaking operands logical operators boolean expressions Python strict nonzero number interpreted true 17 True True flexibility useful subtleties might confusing might want avoid unless know doing54Conditional executionIn order write useful programs almost always need ability check conditions change behavior program accordingly Conditional statements give us ability simplest form statement x 0 print x positive boolean expression called condition true indented statement gets executed nothing happensif statements structure function definitions header followed indented body Statements like called compound statements limit number statements appear body least one Occasionally useful body statements usually place keeper code havent written yet case use pass statement nothing x 0 pass need handle negative values 55 Alternative execution5543Alternative executionA second form statement alternative execution two possibilities condition determines one gets executed syntax looks like thisif x2 0 print x even else print x odd remainder x divided 2 0 know x even program displays message effect condition false second set statements executed Since condition must true false exactly one alternatives executed alternatives called branches branches flow execution56Chained conditionalsSometimes two possibilities need two branches One way express computation like chained conditionalif x print x less elif x print x greater else print x equal elif abbreviation else if exactly one branch executed limit number elif statements else clause end doesnt one choice drawa elif choice b drawb elif choice c drawc condition checked order first false next checked one true corresponding branch executes statement ends Even one condition true first true branch executes57Nested conditionalsOne conditional also nested within another could written trichotomy example like thisif x print x equal else x 44Chapter 5 Conditionals recursionprint x less else print x greater outer conditional contains two branches first branch contains simple statement second branch contains another statement two branches two branches simple statements although could conditional statements well Although indentation statements makes structure apparent nested conditionals become difficult read quickly general good idea avoid Logical operators often provide way simplify nested conditional statements example rewrite following code using single conditionalif 0 x x 10 print x positive singledigit number print statement executed make past conditionals get effect operator 0 x x 10 print x positive singledigit number58RecursionIt legal one function call another also
